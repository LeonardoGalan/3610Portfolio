            <h3> A video about 3 life lessons a man learns during his journey as a data analyst. The first is how being loyal to a company is a foolish idea, since a company can lay you off or shut down, and the consequence of that is losing all source of income if that is the case. It is better to have a plan in mind rather than having to work for someone else for the rest of your life.</h3>
